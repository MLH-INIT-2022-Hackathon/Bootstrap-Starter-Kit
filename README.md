This is a starter kit that helps people to get started with Bootstrap by creating a website!

You can clone it and it will give you a basic Bootstrap project that you can use for a hacathon! Feel free to edit it!

## How to use?
You should clone this repo (or download it as a .zip file) to your computer. If you download it as a .zip, you will need to uncompress(open) it. You can then open the folder in any code editor, including VS Code and Atom.

There are lots of example files in the repo. Feel free to change or remove them!
